# Contributing to herocast

Thank you for considering contributing to herocast. We welcome any contributions that can help improve the project, including bug reports, feature requests, and code changes.

## Getting Started

### Dev Setup

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hellno/herocast.git
```

2. Install Supabase CLI:

-   For Linux or macOS with Homebrew installed:
    ```bash
    brew install supabase/tap/supabase
    ```
-   For other platforms, download the .deb/.apk/.rpm from [here](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases) and install it.

3. Install dependencies:

-   Install NVM (Node Version Manager) by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).
-   Switch to the appropriate Node version:
    ```bash
    nvm use
    ```
    If the version is not installed, use the following command to install it:
    ```bash
    nvm install
    ```
-   Install Yarn (if not already installed for this Node version):
    ```bash
    npm -g install yarn
    ```
-   Install packages:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

4. Create a file `.env.development.local`:

-   For macOS or Linux:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.development.local
    ```
-   For Windows:
    ```bash
    xcopy .env.example .env.development.local
    ```

5. Set up your environment variables:

#### Neynar API KEY

-   Go to [Neynar's Dev Portal](https://dev.neynar.com/) and sign up for the cheapest plan.
-   Once you have access to the dashboard, copy the API Key from the main page at the top.
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_NEYNAR_API_KEY = 'neynar-api-key-here'
    ```

#### Alchemy API Key

-   Go to [Alchemy's website](https://alchemy.com) and get your API Key.
-   Create a new account and select the "Free" option.
-   Select the "Optimism" chain and fill out the necessary information.
-   In the "Apps" section, find your Optimism App and click the "API Key" button.
-   Copy the API Key to your `.env.development.local`.
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY = 'alchemy-api-key-here'
    ```

#### Farcaster account information

-   Get a dev account for Farcaster and save your main account's mnemonic phrase.
-   To find the mnemonic phrase, go to the mobile app: Settings (gear icon) -> Advanced -> Recovery Phrase.
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_MNEMONIC = 'candy maple cake sugar honey ... potato blue'
    ```
-   Find your FID in your account's About information. It is labeled as `FID`, e.g., `FID: 1234`.
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_FID = '123'
    ```

#### Docker

-   If you don't have Docker installed, you can download it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
-   Once installed, make sure Docker daemon is running. You can test it by running `docker ps` in your terminal. If it fails, you will need to start the Docker daemon.

#### Supabase API information

-   Start your local Supabase instance:
    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```
    This may take a while to download all the containers and get started.
-   Once it's done, find the 'API KEY' and 'anon key' by running the command:
    ```bash
    supabase status
    ```
    Save them as:
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = '<API URL>'
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = '<anon key>'
    ```
    
6. Set up accounts table signer encryption in your SQL Editor:

-   Open the Studio URL in the browser and navigate to the SQL Editor tab
-   Generate a private encryption key:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pgsodium.create_key();
    ```
-   Get the key ID (copy the id obtained, as it is needed in the next command):
    ```sql
    SELECT id FROM pgsodium.valid_key LIMIT 1;
    ```
-   Run the following command (replace <PG_SODIUM_KEY> with the id from the previous command):
    ```sql
    SECURITY LABEL FOR "pgsodium" ON COLUMN "public"."accounts"."private_key" IS 'ENCRYPT WITH KEY ID <PG_SODIUM_KEY> SECURITY INVOKER';
    ```
    You should get the response "Success. No rows returned" indicating that the command was successful and returned no rows.

7. Run the local app in development mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will output:

```bash
$ next dev
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Environments: .env.development.local, .env.development
...
âœ“ Ready in 2.4s
```

Click the localhost link to open the app in your browser. If the compilation fails due to missing .env variables, double-check the spelling of the variable names.

Congratulations! You now have a local version of herocast working.

### Run as a Native App

...coming back soon via [tauri](https://tauri.app/)...

### DB Scheme: Accounts

Reminder: The key is an edcsa key, not a 'normal' EVM address.

### Testing Transactions

Running transaction testing on a test network is critical for making sure transactions work as intended before they are used on live servers.
